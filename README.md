# Reviewabot
A friend that can help you review PRs when there are no one else to help you.

## Limitations
This is a very simple bot that uses the OpenAI API to generate a review message for a PR. 
It is not very smart and will not be able to provide a lot of help. 
It is more of a proof of concept than a real tool.

The reason is that the tool does not have the entire context of the repository like GitHub copilot would have.

So there might be better solutions out there. And I am sure that GitHub is working on a CodeReview Bot that will be able to do this better.

## How to use this too
### 1. Create a user account for the reviewer/bot and add it as a collaborator
Go to Github and create a new user account that will be used to review the PRs. Add the new user as a collaborator to your repository.
### 2. Create a Personal Access Token
Under settings for the new user account, create a new Personal Access Token that has access to source and read/write to Pull Requests.
### 3. Create an OpenAI API key
Go to OpenAI and create an API key.
### 4. Create a GitHub Action in your repository
Create a new GitHub Action in your repository that runs the Reviewabot. Use the action from the Marketplace.

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reviewabot

### 5. Create a PR and assign your reviewer to it
Create a PR and assign the reviewer to it. The reviewer will then generate a review message for the PR.
The reviewer will always approve your PR.

### Debugging the pipeline
_The pipeline is skipped_
This is most likeley because the repository action variable `REVIEWER_NAME` has the wrong value. 
It should be the name of the user that reviews the code. It is the user that you created in step 1.

## How to run this locally
Download the source and run the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
dotnet run --owner={repo_owner} --repo={repository} --prnumber={pr-number} --openapikey={apenai-api-key} --githubpat={github-pat}
```

Here is an example where we review PR #4 in the GitHub repository `https://github.com/simon-k/hello-api/`.
The GitHub user that does the review is represented by it's PAT `YYY`. We use the OpenAI API key `XXX` to generate the review with GPT4o. 

```bash
dotnet run --owner=simon-k --repo=hello-api --prnumber=4 --openapikey=XXX --githubpat=YYY
```
